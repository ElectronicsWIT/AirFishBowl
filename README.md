## AirFishBowl
What are we making?

Write up some nice information and introduction for the project.. also why make this private repository ? Open this sucker up!

Look up means to link to images in markdown, we can use the gh-pages branch to store these images!

Need to document process for merging content.. whos doing it whos allowed etc..


### Contents
I've created the initial project directory, we should make an empty OpenPicus project named "AirfishBowl", merge it then with the directory ive added. It contains the source code for adding a new task to the OS...
